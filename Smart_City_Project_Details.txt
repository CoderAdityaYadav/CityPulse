Project Title:
CityPulse: An AI-Driven Smart Companion for Urban Living

Problem Statement:
In rapidly growing cities like Gorakhpur, citizens juggle multiple fragmented apps and systems just to meet everyday needs — reporting a pothole, finding an electrician, renting a room, sharing leftover food, or even checking if a road is blocked due to construction. 
This disjointed approach leads to wasted time, poor coordination, food wastage, delayed emergency responses, and weak community participation.
What’s missing is a unified, intelligent platform that not only connects citizens, service providers, communities, and city officials but also uses AI to predict, recommend, and simplify urban living — turning a complex city into a responsive, people-first ecosystem.

Features:
1. City Issue Tracker
   - Report problems (potholes, leaks, streetlights).
   - AI categorization & clustering.
   - Escalation to city authorities with live map.

2. Food & Resource Sharing
   - Share leftover food, furniture, books.
   - Notify NGOs & volunteers.

3. Community Hub
   - Housing societies, colleges, NGOs form groups.
   - Posts, polls, events, AI digests.

4. Marketplace + Renting
   - Buy/sell second-hand items.
   - Room rentals with secure chat & payments.

5. On-Demand Services
   - Book electricians, plumbers, tutors.
   - Ratings & availability tracking.

6. Emergency Help Layer
   - One-tap SOS (ambulance, fire, police).
   - Auto location sharing + AI first-aid tips.

7. News & Alerts
   - Real-time traffic, weather, city notices.
   - Local Gorakhpur news + AI summaries.

8. Events & Volunteering
   - Festivals, donation drives, hackathons.
   - RSVP + smart recommendations.

9. Gamification & Transparency
   - Badges, leaderboards, reputation system.
   - Public dashboard for issue resolution status.

Tech Stack:
